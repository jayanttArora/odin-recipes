    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      I wanted to share chocolate milkshake recipe from a long time. Finally
      made the recipe and took video. Chocolate milkshake also known as choco
      milkshake is a popular drink with all age groups. There are many methods
      of preparing chocolate milkshake. This is how I make it. I have always
      been making chocolate milkshake with cocoa powder.

    <h4>To get the best taste in Chocolate Milkshake</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>I would suggest using a good quality cocoa powder.</li>
      <li>
        Both ice cream and ice cubes are optional and you can skip them. You can
        add either vanilla ice cream or chocolate ice cream or choco chip ice
        cream in the milkshake.
