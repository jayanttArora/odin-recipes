    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This Caramel Cake recipe is perfect for that die hard caramel fan in your
      life. Homemade caramel sauce is used in the cake layers, frosting, and the
      drip!
    </p>
    <p>
      I am obsessed with how pretty this Caramel Cake turned out. Not only the
      perfectly smooth cake combed sides, but the caramel drip that was just the
      right consistency to not drip all the way down and create a hot mess. It's
      not often things work out smoothly over here, so I need to celebrate it
      when it happens!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Cake:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups white sugar</li>
      <li>1½ cups butter</li>
      <li>5 eggs</li>
      <li>3½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1¼ cups whole milk</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Icing:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup butter</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>⅔ cup evaporated milk</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package confectioners' sugar, sifted</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour three
        9-inch cake pans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cream white sugar, 1 1/2 cups butter, and eggs together in a bowl. Beat
        well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine flour, baking powder, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Add to the sugar
        mixture alternately with milk. Add vanilla extract. Beat until batter
        makes ribbons when falling from the whisk or beater. Divide batter among
        the prepared cake pans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center
        comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool layers on a rack before icing,
        at least 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine brown sugar, 1 cup butter, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a saucepan
        over medium heat. Stir until brown sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes.
        Add evaporated milk and continue stirring. Bring to a gentle boil and
        let bubble for about 4 minutes, stirring constantly to avoid sticking.
        Remove from heat and allow to cool, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix confectioners' sugar and vanilla extract into the butter-milk
        mixture using an electric mixer until icing caramelizes and thickens to
        the desired consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread icing onto the cooled cake layers. Stack layers; ice top and
        sides.
      </li>
    </ol>
