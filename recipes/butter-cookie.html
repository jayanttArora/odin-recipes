    <h3>Decription</h3>
    <p>
      Is there anyone who doesn’t enjoy butter cookies? You definitely need to
      try this version of butter cookies as you will probably change your mind.
      These cookies are soft inside, almost melting in your mouth, with a bit of
      crispy texture on the outside, buttery and rich. They are great alongside
      morning tea or coffee or simply as a snack.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recipe is slightly different from other butter cookie recipes, as the
      batter is creamy and able to be piped. You need to work as quickly as you
      can as the batter can harden and makes the piping more difficult. You can
      make different shapes, and depending on the cookie size the baking time
      may vary as well.

      These beautiful butter cookies are definitely one of the best butter
      cookies I’ve made so far, totally addictive and really delicious.
